## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

The goal of the UI/UX design is to create a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface that reflects modern web standards. The design should:
- Make property discovery and booking seamless
- Provide visual consistency and responsiveness across devices
- Support both guest and host experiences with clear navigation
- Emphasize accessibility, clarity, and minimal friction

### Key Features to Implement

- Responsive Navbar and Footer  
- Property Listing Grid with Search and Filters  
- Listing Details Page with Image Carousel and Descriptions  
- User Authentication (Login/Signup)  
- Host Dashboard for Property Listings  
- Booking Calendar & Checkout Flow  
- Payment Integration  
- User Profiles and Booking History  

### Primary Page Descriptions

| Page                   | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing View  | A grid-based layout showing properties with filters (price, location, etc.) |
| Listing Detailed View  | A detailed view of a selected property, with images, host info, reviews, etc. |
| Simple Checkout View   | A form-based interface for users to book a property, choose dates, and pay  |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A user-friendly design is essential in booking platforms because:
- It enhances trust and engagement from both guests and hosts  
- Reduces confusion and decision friction during the booking flow  
- Helps users complete actions (search, book, list a property) with minimal effort  
- Improves accessibility for all users regardless of device or ability

###  Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Understanding and documenting design properties such as colors and typography ensures:
- **Consistency** across pages and components
- **Efficiency** when collaborating between designers and developers
- **Scalability** by creating reusable styles and themes
- **Brand Identity** through recognizable visuals
- **Accessibility** by maintaining proper contrast and legibility
